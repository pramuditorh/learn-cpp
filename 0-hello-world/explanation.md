### Install IDE
#### Windows 10

  - The installation process is also straightforward, you can click finish until finish.
#### Linux
- Dev-C++
  - As per I am writing this tutorial, it is not recommended to install Dev-C++ on Linux because it is still buggy. I recommend installing Microsoft Visual Studio or Code::Blocks instead.
- Microsoft Visual Studio
  - Open [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) link and click the download button. Make sure you download with the correct distribution of your Linux operating system.
  - Open your terminal.
  - If your distribution is Debian or Ubuntu. Type ```sudo dpkg -i path/to/deb/file```
  - If your distribution is RedHat, Fedora or SUSE. Type ```sudo rpm -i path/to/rpm/file```
